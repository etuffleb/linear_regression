# linear_regression

Linear Regression is the first project of Machine Learning branch in the study program at School 21. You have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

## Mandatory part
Implemented a linear regression algorithm on a single element, the mileage of a car. To do this you must implement 2 programs:
* The first program is used to predict the price of a car based on its mileage. When you launch the program, it asks you for mileage and should give you an approximate price of the car.
* The second program is used to train your model. It will read the dataset and make a linear regression on this data.
